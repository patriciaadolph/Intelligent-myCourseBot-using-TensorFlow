list in python,List datatype in python,"A list is a collection of items in a particular order. You can make a list that
includes the letters of the alphabet, the digits from 0–9, or the names of
all the people in your family. List in Python are ordered and have a definite count. The elements in a list are indexed according to a definite sequence and the indexing of a list is done with 0 being the first index. Each element in the list has its definite place in the list, which allows duplicating of elements in the list, with each element having its own distinct place and credibility.
 A list is defined with square brackets [ ] 
Use commas between elements to separate them 
Lists are ordered and changeable
Lists allow duplicate members
Advanced Topic: Lists are nestable, you can add a list to a list",
Accessing items from a list,How can we access items from a list in python,"To access values in lists, use the square brackets for slicing along with the index or indices to obtain value available at that index. For example: list2 = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 ];
print ""list1[0]: "", list1[0]",
Accessing items from a list,How can we access elements from a list in python,"Lists are ordered collections, so you can access any element in a list by telling Python the position, or index, of the item desired.

Where parent class is the class being inherited from, also called base class and child class is the class that inherits from another class, also called derived class.",
Inheritance in python,Inheritance in python programming language,Inheritance is a powerful feature in object oriented programming. It refers to defining a new class with little or no modification to an existing class. The new class is called derived (or child) class and the one from which it inherits is called the base (or parent) class.,
Ploymorphism in python,What is polymorphism,"The word polymorphism means having many forms. In programming, polymorphism means same function name (but different signatures) being uses for different types.",
Ploymorphism in python,polymorphism in python,Polymorphism means multiple forms. In python we can find the same operator or function taking multiple forms. It also useful in creating different classes which will have class methods with same name. That helps in re using a lot of code and decreases code complexity.,

Datetime module in python,module for date and time in python,"Datetime module in python supplies classes to work with date and time. These classes provide a number of functions to deal with dates, times and time intervals. Date and datetime are an object in Python, so when you manipulate them, you are actually manipulating objects and not string or timestamps.Syntax to import datetime module in python: import datetime ",
Abstraction in python,What is abstraction in python,Abstraction is used to hide internal details and show only functionalities. Abstracting something means to give names to things so that the name captures the core of what a function or a whole program does.,
Abstraction in python,Abstraction in python,"Abstraction in Python is the process of hiding the real implementation of an application from the user and emphasizing only on usage of it. For example, consider you have bought a new electronic gadget. Along with the gadget, you get a user guide, instructing how to use the application, but this user guide has no info regarding the internal working of the gadget.",
Abstraction in python,Abstraction in python programming language,"Abstraction focuses on hiding the internal implementations of a process or method from the user. In this way, the user knows what he is doing but not how the work is being done.Through the process of abstraction in Python, a programmer can hide all the irrelevant data/process of an application in order to reduce complexity and increase efficiency.",
 break statement in python,Break statement in python,The break statement in Python terminates the current loop and resumes execution at the next statement.The most common use for break is when some external condition is triggered requiring a hasty exit from a loop. The break statement can be used in both while and for loops.The keyword break can be used to break the loop.,

The break statement can be used in both while and for loops.The keyword break can be used to break the loop.
continue statement in python,Continue statement in python,The continue statement in Python returns the control to the beginning of the while loop. The continue statement rejects all the remaining statements in the current iteration of the loop and moves the control back to the top of the loop. The continue statement can be used in both while and for loops. The continue keyword can be used to execute the next iteration.,
